# landing-page

I've been learning to code with Project Odin for the last month or so. This is my second project; the first being the recipes project.
I'm pretty proud of the way the site turned out, although I'm sure that the code isn't as elegant as it could be. In this section of the
program, I've really started to be able to see how the items on a web-page are laid out, and how to make those layouts happen using flex.
